# Front

reNFT (not to be confused with insurance) team humbly presents NFT renting!!!

To start the front either follow the vercel link on this page: https://web-two-indol.vercel.app/

or if you are feeling adventurous

## Contracts
- [RenFT](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0xb2c98f7f573bbf653972f030766e36138c82f4a2)
- [Sample NFT For minting and testing on Kovan](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x465DCa9995D6c2a81A9Be80fBCeD5a770dEE3daE#tokentxnsErc721)

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

ensure you are running node `^12.8.0`. I suggest you use nvm to control node versions

and then install the deps

```bash
yarn install
```

after that you are ready to start the front

```bash
yarn react-app:start
```

Make sure you are on Kovan and using MetaMask

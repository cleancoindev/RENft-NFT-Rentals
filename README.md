# Front

reNFT (not to be confused with insurance) team humbly presents NFT renting!!!

To start the front either follow the vercel link on this page: https://web-two-indol.vercel.app/

or if you are feeling adventurous

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

ensure you are running node `^12.8.0`. I suggest you use nvm to control node versions

and then install the deps

```bash
yarn install
```

after that you are ready to start the front

```bash
yarn react-app:start
```

Make sure you are on Kovan and using MetaMask
